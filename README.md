# Facetweak

This is just a demo add-on to show how we could add animation to facebook.
Feel free to extend it into something more useful.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the <code>facetweak-css.js</code> file by running either:

   npm start

   or

   node build.js

3. Open WebIDE and connect your phone
4. Choose &ldquo;Open Packaged App&hellip;&rdquo;
5. Choose the folder for this repository
6. Press &ldquo;Play&rdquo; to install the add-on
7. On your phone, from the Add-ons setting screen, select
   &ldquo;Facetweak&rdquo;
8. Toggle the enable switch
9. Load facebook. If the title chrome turns blue then at least part of it is
   working. If the message compose button is down towards the bottom-right, then
   the rest is working.
